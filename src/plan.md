# Comprehensive Plan for Displaying Dashboard Card After Login

## Plan:

1. **In `LoginPage.jsx`**:
   - Modify the `handleSubmit` function to redirect the user to the dashboard after a successful login instead of just closing the modal. This can be done by using the `useNavigate` hook from `react-router-dom`.

2. **In `App.js`**:
   - Ensure that the routing logic allows navigation to the dashboard upon successful login. This will involve checking the `isLoggedIn` state and rendering the `Dashboard` component accordingly.

3. **In `Dashboard.js`**:
   - Verify that the dashboard card is rendered correctly and is ready to display the necessary information after the user logs in.

## Follow-up Steps:
- After implementing the changes, test the login functionality to ensure that the user is redirected to the dashboard and that the dashboard card displays correctly.
